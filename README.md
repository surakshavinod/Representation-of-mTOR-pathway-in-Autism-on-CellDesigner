# Representation-of-mTOR-pathway-in-Autism-on-CellDesigner
For my Cell Designer for Biochemical Modelling (BT306B) course project, I reconstructed the mTOR pathway in Austism on the CellDesigner software according to my understanding. Started: November 2021 Finished: November 2021
# Description
mTOR pathway plays a significant role in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Several studies have indicated that The Akt/mTOR pathway, which regulates translation at dendritic spines, is a potential molecular substrate of autism, as indicated by multiple studies. Genetic mutations involved in this signaling pathway mediated by mTOR have been identified in syndromic ASD cases. One study found that mutations in the genes encoding the Akt-mTOR cascade components cause disorders with higher rates of autistic characteristics. Hence, this pathway is of immense interest and is a potential target to treat ASD.
# What I Learnt
1. I was able to familiarise myself with CellDesigner's notations and symbols, and the CellDesigner software as a whole.
2. I was able to summarise, visualise and interpret the theory of this pathway.
# Note
I have referred many papers and sites including CellDesigner's official site to reconstruct this pathway. Huge thanks to my course professor as well.
